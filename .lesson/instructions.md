# Instructions  

In this project we will be creating a working version of the game Wordle (https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) by Josh Wardle.

In the official game, the player tries to guess a 5 letter word in 6 tries, getting feedback after each guess about which letters are correct and which are not.

You can copy the classes up-to-date work on the project at the following address: https://replit.com/join/eopbmmtsct-markbetnel.

Please make sure not to edit the copy on Mark's site.

The word list is stored here in the file "words.js"
